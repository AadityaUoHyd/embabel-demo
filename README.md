# Embabel Agent Framework Samples
embabel-demo offers sample projects demonstrating the Embabel Agent Framework for 
building Java applications using Spring, web, and shell integrations.
Embabel is a JVM-based agent framework that lets you build intelligent “agentic flows” 
by combining LLM (large language model) calls with code, using planning, strong typing, 
and composition to build safe, testable AI applications. Here is how for the first time I tried my hands on it.
